Frontend (React) Setup:
1. Prerequisites:

Install Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org.
npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, so once you install Node.js, you should also have npm.

2. Steps:


 i. Extract the Project Folder:

 Unzip the project folder you’ve sent and place it in a location of your choice on your machine.


 ii. Install Dependencies:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend folder (where your package.json is located). If you’ve extracted the project to my-app, run:

cd path/to/my-app


 iii. Install the Node.js dependencies:

Since the node_modules folder is not included in the zip file, you need to install the dependencies manually. Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

npm install


3. Start the Development Server:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server using:

npm start
This will run the React application on http://localhost:3000 by default, unless you configured a different port.
